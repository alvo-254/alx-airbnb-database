üîπ 1. INNER JOIN: Bookings and the respective users
Objective: Retrieve all bookings and the users who made them.

SELECT 
    bookings.id AS booking_id,
    bookings.property_id,
    bookings.start_date,
    bookings.end_date,
    users.id AS user_id,
    users.name AS user_name,
    users.email
FROM 
    bookings
INNER JOIN 
    users ON bookings.user_id = users.id;

üîπ 2. LEFT JOIN: Properties and their reviews (including those without reviews)

SELECT 
    properties.id AS property_id,
    properties.name AS property_name,
    reviews.id AS review_id,
    reviews.rating,
    reviews.comment
FROM 
    properties
LEFT JOIN 
    reviews ON properties.id = reviews.property_id;

üîπ 3. FULL OUTER JOIN: All users and all bookings

SELECT 
    users.id AS user_id,
    users.name AS user_name,
    bookings.id AS booking_id,
    bookings.property_id,
    bookings.start_date,
    bookings.end_date
FROM 
    users
FULL OUTER JOIN 
    bookings ON users.id = bookings.user_id;

üõ†Ô∏è Note: Not all SQL databases support FULL OUTER JOIN directly (e.g., MySQL before v8). If unsupported, use a UNION of LEFT and RIGHT joins as a workaround

SELECT 
    users.id AS user_id,
    users.name AS user_name,
    bookings.id AS booking_id,
    bookings.property_id,
    bookings.start_date,
    bookings.end_date
FROM 
    users
LEFT JOIN 
    bookings ON users.id = bookings.user_id

UNION

SELECT 
    users.id AS user_id,
    users.name AS user_name,
    bookings.id AS booking_id,
    bookings.property_id,
    bookings.start_date,
    bookings.end_date
FROM 
    users
RIGHT JOIN 
    bookings ON users.id = bookings.user_id;
