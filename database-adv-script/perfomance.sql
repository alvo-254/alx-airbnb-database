‚öôÔ∏è 3. Refactor the Query for Performance
Ensure the necessary indexes have been created (see your database_index.sql)

Remove unnecessary columns or JOINs if not required

Use SELECT with specific fields instead of SELECT *

Ensure table filtering or sorting (if any) uses indexed columns

Refactored Query Example (optimized):

sql
Copy
Edit
-- Optimized query: Avoids SELECT *, uses indexed joins, and selects only needed columns
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    b.id AS booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    u.name AS user_name,
    u.email,
    p.name AS property_name,
    pay.amount,
    pay.status
FROM 
    bookings b
JOIN 
    users u ON b.user_id = u.id
JOIN 
    properties p ON b.property_id = p.id
JOIN 
    payments pay ON pay.booking_id = b.id;
