# ðŸ“˜ Task 0: Complex Queries with Joins

This task is part of the **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, focusing on mastering SQL joins for data analysis and retrieval in a simulated Airbnb environment.

## ðŸ§  Objective

Learn and apply SQL join techniques to effectively retrieve and combine data from related tables including `users`, `bookings`, `properties`, and `reviews`.

---

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Familiarity with basic SQL syntax
- Understanding of table relationships
- SQL environment to run queries (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

---

## ðŸ”— Queries Implemented

### 1. INNER JOIN â€” Bookings and Users

Retrieve all bookings along with the user who made each booking.

```sql
SELECT 
    bookings.id AS booking_id,
    bookings.property_id,
    bookings.start_date,
    bookings.end_date,
    users.id AS user_id,
    users.name AS user_name,
    users.email
FROM 
    bookings
INNER JOIN 
    users ON bookings.user_id = users.id;


# ðŸ“˜ Task 1: Practice Subqueries

This task focuses on mastering the use of **SQL subqueries**â€”both correlated and non-correlatedâ€”within the context of the Airbnb database schema. Subqueries are essential for filtering, analyzing, and breaking down complex logic into reusable components.

## ðŸ§  Objective

- Use **non-correlated subqueries** for aggregate analysis.
- Use **correlated subqueries** to dynamically compare data across rows.
- Improve SQL query fluency for data-driven insights.

### 1. ðŸ§® Non-Correlated Subquery â€” Properties with Average Rating > 4.0

Retrieve all properties that have an **average review rating greater than 4.0**.

```sql
SELECT 
    id, 
    name 
FROM 
    properties
WHERE 
    id IN (
        SELECT 
            property_id
        FROM 
            reviews
        GROUP BY 
            property_id
        HAVING 
            AVG(rating) > 4.0
    );

# ðŸ“˜ Task 2: Apply Aggregations and Window Functions

This task demonstrates how to use SQL aggregation and window functions to analyze Airbnb data. Aggregations help summarize data, while window functions provide advanced analytics like ranking and row numbering without collapsing results.

## ðŸ§  Objective

- Use `COUNT()` and `GROUP BY` to summarize data (total bookings per user).
- Use window functions like `RANK()` or `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank results based on aggregated metrics.

### 1. ðŸ§® Total Bookings per User â€” Aggregation with `COUNT()`

```sql
SELECT 
    users.id AS user_id,
    users.name,
    COUNT(bookings.id) AS total_bookings
FROM 
    users
JOIN 
    bookings ON users.id = bookings.user_id
GROUP BY 
    users.id, users.name
ORDER BY 
    total_bookings DESC;
